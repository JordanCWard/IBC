### High-Impact Recommendations:

-   **Capitalize on High-Margin Items:** Focus on subcategories and categories with the highest profit margins, including Accessories (59% margin), Fenders, Bike Stands, and Tires & Tubes.
-   **Optimize Underperforming Products:** Revisit pricing, production, and marketing strategies for subcategories with weak or negative profit margins (e.g., Jerseys, Touring Frames).
-   **Leverage Best-Selling Categories:** Bikes consistently show strong revenue (peaking at $36 million in 2019). Strengthen marketing campaigns and supply chain management around key bike subcategories (Mountain Bikes, Road Bikes) to build momentum.
-   **Tailor Efforts to Top Regions and Customers:** Countries such as France and Germany have higher average revenue per top customer ($13k in France, $10k in Germany). Create targeted promotions or loyalty programs for France and Germany to further increase sales.
